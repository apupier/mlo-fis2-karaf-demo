**FIS2 Karaf Demo - Microsoft loves OpenShift**

This demo shows the integration of FIS2 into the Fabric8 Microservices platform and openshift.io.

### Integration Testing

The example includes a [fabric8 arquillian](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/tree/v2.2.170.redhat/components/fabric8-arquillian) OpenShift Integration Test. 
Once the container image has been built and deployed in OpenShift, the integration test can be run with:

    mvn test -Dtest=*KT

The test is disabled by default and has to be enabled using `-Dtest`. Open Source Community documentation at [Integration Testing](https://fabric8.io/guide/testing.html) and [Fabric8 Arquillian Extension](https://fabric8.io/guide/arquillian.html) provide more information on writing full fledged black box integration tests for OpenShift.
